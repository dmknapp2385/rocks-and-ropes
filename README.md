6. The Weights page then has three more links (Free Weights, Rings, and TRX Bands), and by clicking on each of these links you will be taken to the different pages associated with each type of equipment.
7. Similar to the Upstairs page, each category of weights will contain an image and description for each piece and type of equipment. 
8. If you want to experience the full capabilities of the Rocks and Ropes application, you are going to want to sign up and create an account.
9. To sign up, follow the link in the navigation bar which will take you to the login page where you can click a button to be taken to the sign up page if you do not already have an account.
10. Once clicking on the sign up page, you will create a username, enter your email, and then enter a password. Make sure you follow the requirements for username and password length as well as enter a valid email.
11. Once you have created an account, you will now have the ability to add exercises to your own personalized weekly calendar. 
12. To add exercises, you can visit any of the Weights pages or the Upstairs page, and there will now be a button to Add to Calendar.

14. Once you hit save, the activity will be added to your weekly calendar, which you can view by visiting the See Your Exercises navigation link.
15. This link will take you to your weekly calendar which has all of the days of the week, and then under each day it will have any exercises you have added for that day's workout.
